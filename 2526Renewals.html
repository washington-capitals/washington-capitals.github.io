                <p class="statement">We can create a new front door to D.C. and become a catalyst for
                  the city and our community. We’re going to be dynamic and innovative and looking
                  around corners. We’re going to be iconic.</br></br>
                  What excites me about what we’re doing now is we can reshape downtown. We can
                  connect downtown with the National Mall. We can create a new front door to D.C. and
                  redefine a new Washington D.C. landscape. This should be part of the iconography of
                  the city. </br></br>Organizationally, we want to be a catalyst for development in
                  the most important city in the world. It’s a piece of real estate blocks from the
                  National Mall, blocks from the Capitol, blocks from the White House.</br></br>
                  We’re doing this with the mindset of creating the best hockey experience in the NHL.
                  Ezra Pound was a philosopher, thinker, teacher in the 1950s and 60s and he said,
                  ‘Make it new.’ That’s our charge with Capital One Arena: Make it new. We want to be
                  a must-see and must-have, and be one of the most important companies in the most
                  important city. We’re going to spend a billion dollars because the building has to
                  be redefined. Because we have to make it new, make a big investment in sports,
                  music, business, art.</br></br>

                  D.C.'s Next Great Monument is a symbol not of the past, but the future - built by
                  first-movers, built on momentum, built to make new history. In one of the nation's
                  most powerful zip codes, where all Metro lines converge and all roads lead, between
                  the White House and U.S. Capitol, we're creating a new place to bring people
                  together — a world-class arena that will deliver world-class experiences.

            <button class="accordion">What are my options for receiving the funds when selling tickets
              through the NHL TicketExchange? </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">Season Ticket Members have two options for receiving
              resale credit when selling tickets through the NHL TicketExchange. The first option is
              direct deposit, this option will have all resale credit from sold tickets deposited directly
              into an eligible checking or savings account 5-7 days after the game has been played. The
              second option is seller credit, this option will have all resale credit from sold tickets
              deposited directly into your Capitals team account which will be credited towards future
              seasons twice per year, first during the renewal period and second on or about July
              15th.<br><i>*Please note: the only way to access funds from sold tickets immediately is to
                select the direct deposit option. If seller credit is preferred, you must have this
                option turned on by your Membership Services Manager or by calling us at (202) 266-2350.
                If the seller credit option is selected, funds will be held in your Washington Capitals
                account and distributed twice annually directly to your ticket invoice for the next
                season. The first being on your renewal invoice and the second being just prior to the
                July 15 payment. </i></div><button class="accordion">I have resale credit on my team
              account, can I use it to make my regular monthly payments? </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">No, any resale credit accrued by the resale of 2024-25
              regular-season tickets and 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs can only be used towards the 2025-26
              regular season when applied during the renewal period or the July funds transfer. Resale
              credit for tickets sold from the start of the 2024-25 season up to January 31, 2025, will be
              noted on your 2025-26 renewal invoice and applied to your renewal balance. Resale credit for
              tickets sold on or after January 31, 2025, will automatically be applied prior to your
              account on or about July 15, 2025, reducing your overall account balance. Resale credit in
              your team account can only be used toward future seasons or ticket purchases.

            <h3>Select-A-Seat FAQs</h3>
            <button class="accordion">What is Select-A-Seat? </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;"> Our annual event where full season-ticket members can
              relocate their seats for the upcoming season based on availability. The 2025-26
              Select-A-Seat event will be held online using our virtual venue platform on at a future
              date, and is the only relocation opportunity for the upcoming 2025-26 season. In order to
              participate in our Select-A-Seat event you must be renewed by the March 17, 2025 deadline.
            </div>
            <button class="accordion">How are the time slots assigned for this event? </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">The time slots are assigned based on the number of
              RSVPs and the "since date" (tenure) for each account, sorted by account number. Time slots
              are not consistent year over year, however the most tenured accounts will always have the
              earliest access to the Select-A-Seat event. Due to the large number of accounts, there is
              the possibility that accounts within the same "since date" will be split between different
              time slots with the earliest account numbers getting the first time slot in that tenure
              group.</div>
            <button class="accordion">I have a friend with a later time slot; can they come to my time slot?
            </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;"> No, in order for you and your friend to relocate
              seats together, you must attend the later of the two time slots to maintain the tenure
              system by which times were assigned.
            </div><button class="accordion">I can't make the Select-A-Seat, can I have a share partner move
              my seats?</button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;"> Yes, you will be able to select a share partner as a
              proxy. However, if your share partner selects a location that you are not happy with, you
              will not have another relocation opportunity.</div>
            <button class="accordion">What will be available during my time slot?</button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;"> We can't guarantee specific locations during a
              specific time slot. The Select-A-Seat event is very fluid and available inventory will be
              changing during each time slot. Throughout the event, we will have representatives on the
              phones to assist with questions.</div>
            <button class="accordion">I know someone that did not renew their seats, can I move into those?
            </button>
            <div class="panel" style="display: none;">If those seats are open and available at your assigned
              time slot during the event you are welcome to move into them. To maintain the integrity of
              the event and our loyalty program, all non-renewed and open inventory will be made available
              to season-ticket members based on their assigned time slot.
